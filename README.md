You can install this as a Firefox addon [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/local-cache/).

Not available on Chrome store, but it is compatible if you install it manually.

To build this extension, run `./build.sh` on any unix-like system. Requires `yarn` to be installed, but `npm` can be used too. No specific versions required, but most recently built with `npm 8.4.1` and `node v16.14.0`. The resulting extension will be placed inside `/dist`.
